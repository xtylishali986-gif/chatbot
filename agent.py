# agent.py
# WHAT: LangGraph agent with 5 tools — product search, policy RAG, order
# lookup, lead capture, and human escalation — now fully MULTI-TENANT.
# WHY: client_id lives in AgentState (same pattern as session_id from
# Phase 5) and is injected into every tool call from tools_node, never
# from the model. Model name updated to openai/gpt-oss-120b since
# llama-3.3-70b-versatile is no longer available on this account. Tool
# calling made more robust against model quirks: tools are OMITTED from
# the request entirely (not just soft-disabled via tool_choice="none")
# once one round has happened, and a BadRequestError from a hallucinated/
# malformed tool name triggers one graceful retry without tools.
